# ClickHouse Advanced Queries: Unleashing the Power Within

Welcome back, query wizard-in-training! üßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

We've come such a long way together! You can design schemas like a pro, build data pipelines that would make an engineer weep tears of joy, and now it's time for my favorite part: making ClickHouse do amazing things with advanced queries.

Think of this as learning the secret spells of the database world. We're going beyond basic SELECT statements and diving into features that make ClickHouse special - the kind of stuff that makes other database users a little jealous.

## Materialized Views: Your Always-Updated Best Friend

Materialized views in ClickHouse are like having a really efficient assistant who updates your reports automatically. They're not just stored query results - they're live, always-current aggregations that update as new data arrives.

### Basic Materialized Views

Let's start with something practical - real-time sales metrics:

```

-- First, create a summary table
CREATE TABLE daily_sales_summary (
date Date,
product_category String,
total_sales Decimal(12, 2),
order_count UInt32,
avg_order_value Decimal(10, 2)
) ENGINE = SummingMergeTree(total_sales, order_count)
ORDER BY (date, product_category)
PARTITION BY toYYYYMM(date);

-- Now create the materialized view
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW sales_summary_mv TO daily_sales_summary AS
SELECT
toDate(order_timestamp) as date,
product_category,
sum(order_total) as total_sales,
count() as order_count,
avg(order_total) as avg_order_value
FROM orders
GROUP BY date, product_category;

```

Now, every time you insert data into the `orders` table, your summary gets updated automatically. It's like magic, but better because you understand how it works!

### Advanced Materialized Views with Complex Logic

```

-- Real-time user engagement scoring
CREATE TABLE user_engagement_scores (
user_id UInt32,
date Date,
page_views UInt32,
session_duration UInt32,
purchases UInt32,
engagement_score Float32
) ENGINE = ReplacingMergeTree()
ORDER BY (user_id, date)
PARTITION BY toYYYYMM(date);

CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW user_engagement_mv TO user_engagement_scores AS
SELECT
user_id,
toDate(event_timestamp) as date,
countIf(event_type = 'page_view') as page_views,
sumIf(session_duration, event_type = 'session_end') as session_duration,
countIf(event_type = 'purchase') as purchases,
-- Custom engagement scoring formula
(countIf(event_type = 'page_view') * 1.0 +
sumIf(session_duration, event_type = 'session_end') / 60.0 +
countIf(event_type = 'purchase') * 10.0) as engagement_score
FROM user_events
GROUP BY user_id, date;

```

This view automatically calculates daily engagement scores for each user. Dashboard queries that used to take minutes now take milliseconds!

## Window Functions: Your Time-Series Superhero

Window functions are where ClickHouse really shows off. They let you perform calculations across related rows without grouping, which is perfect for time-series analysis.

### Running Totals and Moving Averages

```

-- Calculate running totals and 7-day moving averages
SELECT
date,
daily_revenue,
-- Running total (cumulative sum)
sum(daily_revenue) OVER (ORDER BY date) as running_total,
-- 7-day moving average
avg(daily_revenue) OVER (
ORDER BY date
ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
) as moving_avg_7d,
-- Compare to previous day
lagInFrame(daily_revenue, 1) OVER (ORDER BY date) as prev_day_revenue,
daily_revenue - lagInFrame(daily_revenue, 1) OVER (ORDER BY date) as day_over_day_change
FROM daily_sales
ORDER BY date;

```

### Ranking and Percentiles

```

-- Find top performers by category
SELECT
product_category,
product_name,
total_sales,
-- Rank within category
row_number() OVER (
PARTITION BY product_category
ORDER BY total_sales DESC
) as rank_in_category,
-- What percentile is this product in?
percent_rank() OVER (
PARTITION BY product_category
ORDER BY total_sales
) as percentile_rank,
-- Sales as percentage of category total
total_sales / sum(total_sales) OVER (PARTITION BY product_category) as pct_of_category
FROM product_sales
WHERE rank_in_category <= 10;

```

### Cohort Analysis Made Easy

```

-- User retention cohort analysis
WITH user_cohorts AS (
SELECT
user_id,
min(toDate(first_seen)) as cohort_month,
toDate(event_date) as event_month
FROM user_activity
GROUP BY user_id, event_month
)
SELECT
cohort_month,
event_month,
count(DISTINCT user_id) as active_users,
-- Months since first activity
dateDiff('month', cohort_month, event_month) as period_number,
-- Retention rate for this cohort
count(DISTINCT user_id) /
first_value(count(DISTINCT user_id)) OVER (
PARTITION BY cohort_month
ORDER BY event_month
) as retention_rate
FROM user_cohorts
GROUP BY cohort_month, event_month
ORDER BY cohort_month, event_month;

```

## Array Functions: Handling Complex Data Like a Pro

ClickHouse's array functions are incredibly powerful for analyzing complex, nested data. They're like having a Swiss Army knife for data analysis.

### Working with User Journeys

```

-- Analyze user journey paths
SELECT
user_id,
-- Create array of pages visited in order
groupArray(page_url) as user_journey,
-- How many steps in their journey?
length(groupArray(page_url)) as journey_length,
-- What was their entry point?
groupArray(page_url)[^3] as entry_page,
-- Where did they end up?
groupArray(page_url)[-1] as exit_page,
-- Did they visit the checkout page?
has(groupArray(page_url), '/checkout') as visited_checkout
FROM (
SELECT user_id, page_url
FROM page_views
WHERE date = today()
ORDER BY user_id, timestamp
)
GROUP BY user_id
HAVING journey_length > 1;

```

### Advanced Array Operations

```

-- Analyze purchase patterns
SELECT
user_id,
purchase_dates,
purchase_amounts,
-- Calculate days between purchases
arrayMap((x, y) -> dateDiff('day', x, y),
arrayPopBack(purchase_dates),
arrayPopFront(purchase_dates)) as days_between_purchases,
-- Average time between purchases
arrayAvg(arrayMap((x, y) -> dateDiff('day', x, y),
arrayPopBack(purchase_dates),
arrayPopFront(purchase_dates))) as avg_days_between,
-- Find their biggest purchase
arrayMax(purchase_amounts) as max_purchase,
-- What's their purchase frequency?
length(purchase_dates) / dateDiff('day', min(purchase_dates), max(purchase_dates)) as purchases_per_day
FROM (
SELECT
user_id,
groupArray(purchase_date) as purchase_dates,
groupArray(amount) as purchase_amounts
FROM purchases
GROUP BY user_id
HAVING length(purchase_dates) > 1
)
WHERE length(purchase_dates) > 2;

```

## Approximate Functions: Speed When Perfect Isn't Necessary

Sometimes you need answers fast, and "approximately right" is better than "precisely slow." ClickHouse excels at approximate algorithms.

### Unique Counting at Scale

```

-- Count unique visitors (approximately) - much faster than COUNT(DISTINCT)
SELECT
date,
uniq(user_id) as unique_visitors_approx,
-- For comparison (much slower on large datasets):
-- count(DISTINCT user_id) as unique_visitors_exact
FROM page_views
GROUP BY date
ORDER BY date;

-- Unique visitors by hour with 99% accuracy
SELECT
toStartOfHour(timestamp) as hour,
uniqExact(user_id) as exact_count,          -- Slow but accurate
uniq(user_id) as approx_count,              -- Fast, ~98% accuracy
uniqCombined(user_id) as combined_count,    -- Good balance
-- Calculate the difference
abs(uniqExact(user_id) - uniq(user_id)) as difference
FROM page_views
WHERE timestamp >= today() - 1
GROUP BY hour
ORDER BY hour;

```

### Quantile Estimation

```

-- Fast percentile calculations
SELECT
product_category,
-- Approximate quantiles (much faster)
quantile(0.5)(price) as median_price,
quantile(0.95)(price) as p95_price,
quantile(0.99)(price) as p99_price,
-- Multiple quantiles at once (even faster)
quantiles(0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.95)(price) as quartiles
FROM products
GROUP BY product_category;

```

## Advanced Analytics Patterns

### Funnel Analysis

```

-- E-commerce conversion funnel
SELECT
-- Stage definitions
countIf(event_type = 'page_view' AND page_url LIKE '%/product/%') as product_views,
countIf(event_type = 'add_to_cart') as cart_adds,
countIf(event_type = 'checkout_start') as checkout_starts,
countIf(event_type = 'purchase') as purchases,

    -- Conversion rates
    countIf(event_type = 'add_to_cart') / 
        countIf(event_type = 'page_view' AND page_url LIKE '%/product/%') as view_to_cart_rate,
    countIf(event_type = 'checkout_start') / 
        countIf(event_type = 'add_to_cart') as cart_to_checkout_rate,
    countIf(event_type = 'purchase') / 
        countIf(event_type = 'checkout_start') as checkout_to_purchase_rate,
    
    -- Overall conversion
    countIf(event_type = 'purchase') / 
        countIf(event_type = 'page_view' AND page_url LIKE '%/product/%') as overall_conversion_rate
    FROM user_events
WHERE timestamp >= today() - 7;

```

### Anomaly Detection

```

-- Simple anomaly detection using statistical methods
WITH daily_stats AS (
SELECT
date,
count() as daily_events,
avg(count()) OVER (
ORDER BY date
ROWS BETWEEN 7 PRECEDING AND 1 PRECEDING
) as avg_events_7d,
stddevPop(count()) OVER (
ORDER BY date
ROWS BETWEEN 7 PRECEDING AND 1 PRECEDING
) as stddev_events_7d
FROM events
GROUP BY toDate(timestamp)
ORDER BY date
)
SELECT
date,
daily_events,
avg_events_7d,
-- Z-score for anomaly detection
(daily_events - avg_events_7d) / nullIf(stddev_events_7d, 0) as z_score,
-- Flag potential anomalies (z-score > 2 or < -2)
abs((daily_events - avg_events_7d) / nullIf(stddev_events_7d, 0)) > 2 as is_anomaly
FROM daily_stats
WHERE date >= today() - 30
ORDER BY date;

```

## Performance Optimization Tricks

### Query Optimization Magic

```

-- Use PREWHERE for early filtering (processes before reading all columns)
SELECT user_id, page_url, timestamp
FROM page_views
PREWHERE timestamp >= today() - 7  -- This filter runs first
WHERE user_id > 1000;              -- This filter runs after

-- Optimize aggregations with the right order
SELECT
country,
device_type,
count() as sessions
FROM sessions
WHERE date = today()
GROUP BY country, device_type
-- Put high-cardinality columns first in GROUP BY for better performance
ORDER BY sessions DESC;

-- Use sampling for exploratory analysis
SELECT
avg(session_duration),
quantile(0.5)(session_duration)
FROM sessions SAMPLE 0.1  -- Use 10% of data for much faster results
WHERE date >= today() - 30;

```

### Memory-Efficient Queries

```

-- Use LIMIT BY to get top N per group efficiently
SELECT user_id, timestamp, page_url
FROM page_views
WHERE date = today()
ORDER BY user_id, timestamp DESC
LIMIT 5 BY user_id;  -- Get last 5 page views per user

-- Efficient distinct counting
SELECT
date,
uniqCombined(12)(user_id) as unique_users  -- Use 12-bit precision for memory efficiency
FROM page_views
GROUP BY date
ORDER BY date;

```

## Integration with Visualization Tools

### Grafana Integration

```

-- Time-series query for Grafana dashboard
SELECT
toStartOfMinute(timestamp) as time,
count() as requests_per_minute,
avg(response_time) as avg_response_time,
quantile(0.95)(response_time) as p95_response_time
FROM api_logs
WHERE \$__timeFilter(timestamp)  -- Grafana macro for time filtering
GROUP BY time
ORDER BY time;

```

### Building APIs with ClickHouse

```

-- Query for a real-time dashboard API
SELECT
'total_users' as metric,
toString(uniq(user_id)) as value,
'number' as type
FROM user_events
WHERE timestamp >= now() - INTERVAL 1 DAY

UNION ALL

SELECT
'avg_session_duration' as metric,
toString(round(avg(session_duration), 2)) as value,
'seconds' as type
FROM sessions
WHERE start_time >= now() - INTERVAL 1 DAY;

```

## Your Advanced Query Challenge

Here's a fun challenge to test your new skills:

1. **Build a user segmentation query** that uses window functions to categorize users as "new," "returning," or "at-risk" based on their activity patterns
2. **Create a materialized view** that maintains real-time conversion funnel metrics
3. **Write an anomaly detection query** that finds unusual patterns in your data
4. **Use array functions** to analyze user journey patterns

Don't worry if it takes a few tries - advanced querying is as much art as science!
