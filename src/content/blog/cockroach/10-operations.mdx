<p class="lead text-xl text-gray-300 mb-8">
    Congratulations! You've made it to the end. You know how to build apps, but how do you keep the database running?
</p>

<h2>Backups</h2>
<p>
    CockroachDB supports distributed backups to object storage (S3, GCS).
</p>
```sql
BACKUP DATABASE defaultdb TO 's3://my-bucket/backups';
```
<p>
    Because it's distributed, every node uploads its own ranges in parallel. It's incredibly fast.
</p>

<h2>Monitoring</h2>
<p>
    The built-in DB Console is great, but for production, you should export metrics to Prometheus and visualize them in Grafana.
</p>
<p>
    Key metrics to watch:
</p>
<ul class="list-disc ml-4 space-y-2 text-gray-300">
    <li><strong>SQL Latency:</strong> Is it getting slower?</li>
    <li><strong>CPU Usage:</strong> Are nodes overloaded?</li>
    <li><strong>Under-replicated Ranges:</strong> Are you at risk of data loss?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>
    CockroachDB is a powerful tool. It solves scalability and consistency problems that used to require an army of engineers. Go forth and build resilient applications!
