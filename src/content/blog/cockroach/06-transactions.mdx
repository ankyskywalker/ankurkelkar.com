    Most NoSQL databases sacrifice consistency for scale. CockroachDB refuses to compromise. It gives you both.
</p>

<h2>Serializable Isolation</h2>
<p>
    In the database world, "Serializable" is the gold standard. It means the database behaves as if transactions were executed one after another, even if they actually ran in parallel.
</p>
<p>
    CockroachDB runs at <strong>Serializable Isolation</strong> by default. You cannot lower it. This means you never have to worry about:
</p>
<ul class="list-disc ml-4 space-y-2 text-gray-300">
    <li>Dirty Reads</li>
    <li>Non-repeatable Reads</li>
    <li>Phantom Reads</li>
</ul>

<h2>Time Travel Queries</h2>
<p>
    Because CockroachDB uses Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC), it keeps old versions of your data for a configurable amount of time (default 25 hours).
</p>
<p>
    You can query the database as it existed in the past!
</p>
```sql
SELECT * FROM users AS OF SYSTEM TIME '-10m';
```
<p>
    This is incredibly useful for debugging or generating consistent reports without locking tables.
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
    Strong consistency makes building applications much easier. You don't have to handle weird race conditions in your code. But consistency comes at a cost: performance. Let's tune it.
