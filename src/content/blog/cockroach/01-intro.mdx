    Welcome to "CockroachDB: From Zero to Hero". In this first part, we're going to explore why this database is named after the most resilient creature on Earth and how it brings Google Spanner-like capabilities to the masses.
</p>

<h2>The Origin Story</h2>
<p>
    Imagine a database that you can't kill. You can unplug servers, cut fiber optic cables, or even lose an entire datacenter, and it just keeps working. That's the promise of CockroachDB.
</p>
<p>
    Inspired by the Google Spanner whitepaper, CockroachDB was built to solve the hardest problem in databases: <strong>Horizontal Scalability + Strong Consistency</strong>.
</p>

<h2>Architecture in a Nutshell</h2>
<p>
    CockroachDB isn't just a single binary; it's a distributed system. Here are the key concepts you need to know:
</p>

        <h4 class="text-indigo-300 font-bold mb-2">The KV Store</h4>
        <p>
            At its heart, CockroachDB is a giant, sorted Key-Value store. Every table, row, and index is mapped to a key-value pair.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="bg-slate-800/50 p-6 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-purple-500">
        <h4 class="text-purple-300 font-bold mb-2">Ranges</h4>
        <p>
            Data is split into 512MB chunks called "Ranges". These ranges are replicated (usually 3 times) across different nodes using the Raft consensus algorithm.
        </p>
    </div>
</div>

<h2>Raft Consensus</h2>
<p>
    How does it ensure data is consistent? It uses <strong>Raft</strong>. For every Range, there is a "Raft Group" of 3 replicas. One is the <em>Leaseholder</em> (the boss), and the others are followers. Writes must be acknowledged by a majority (2 out of 3) to be committed.
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
    CockroachDB is complex under the hood so that it can be simple for you to use. It looks like Postgres, but acts like a distributed system. In the next part, we'll spin up a cluster and see it in action.
